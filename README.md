# Human Body Temperature

##### In this project we will compare Carl Wunderlich's mean of a healthy human body temperature of 98.6 degrees Fahrenheit, reported in his book published in 1868, with our population sample.

### Results - 
##### We strongly reject Carl's hypothesis that the mean of a healthy human body temperature is 98.6, and we have a 95% confidence that the true mean lies between 98.12 - 98.37 degrees Fahrenheit.
